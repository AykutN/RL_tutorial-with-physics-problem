In this reinforcement learning example, there is problem about finding minimum x point for potential energy of Leonnard Jones Potential Energy. 
you can find the equation of potential energy in wikipedia site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential

environment created as potential energy and actions with gym that are discreted for now.
There is three action: 
                    1) add 0.01 nanometer to available x point
                    2) add -0.01 nanometer to available x point
                    3) stop at available x point

for action selecting used for Pytorch DQN model
